# HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell Library

This lab introduces the HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell module, a
set of cmdlets for managing and automating your HPE GreenLake
environment. The module enables direct interaction with HPE GreenLake
and Compute Ops Management services from the PowerShell command line,
fitting easily into existing automation workflows.

Development is ongoing. SaaS cloud applications evolve over time. Therefore, this library
will be continuously updated to incorporate new features as they are released by HPE.

This module is available in the PowerShell Gallery under the name [HPECOMCmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HPECOMCmdlets), following the naming convention used by most HPE modules.

The PowerShell Gallery is a repository for sharing and distributing
PowerShell modules and scripts. It's a community-driven platform that
provides access to various PowerShell resources, enabling you to easily
discover, install, and publish your own PowerShell content. The
PowerShell Gallery can be accessed through the PowerShellGet module
(includes **Install-Module**, **Find-Module**, etc.), which comes
pre-installed with Windows PowerShell 5.0 and above.

This project is also associated with a new public GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library)
from our community contributor, Lionel Jullien from HPE. This repository
is where the source code is developed. You can also track
[releases](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/releases),
report and view
[issues](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/issues),
and participate in
[discussions](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/discussions).

that you complete the cleanup process outlined in [Step
11](#step-11-clean-the-lab-for-the-next-participant-required-before-leaving).
This step ensures all resources used during your lab session are
properly released and made available for the next participant.
Neglecting to follow the cleanup instructions could disrupt subsequent
lab sessions. Please carefully review and complete the cleanup process
before departing.

## Preparation for using the PowerShell library

To use the HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell Library, an HPE
GreenLake account is required. The library supports two authentication
methods:

**HPE Account credentials---single-factor authentication (with or ithout MFA).**

- Requires an HPE Account (username and password)

- Direct authentication using HPE Account credentials

**Single Sign-On (SSO) passwordless authentication**

- Requires a properly configured Identity provider (IdP) such as Okta, PingIdentity, or Microsoft Entra ID.

- User authentication is handled through an external Identity Provider using SAML 2.0.

- For more details, see [SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) with passwordless authentication](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library?tab=readme-ov-file#saml-single-sign-on-sso-with-passwordless-authentication).

If you have an HPE GreenLake account or a workspace with properly
configured SSO for passwordless access, **skip this section.**

> ⚠️ **Important note**
> If your user account uses an identity provider---whether supported (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, PingIdentity) or unsupported---that does
> not use passwordless authentication methods (push notifications or TOTP), authentication with the *Connect-HPEGL* cmdlet will fail.

> 💡 Note
> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) was implemented with the release of version [1.0.12](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/releases/tag/v1.0.12) of the HPECOMCmdlets PowerShell Library. SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) support for the three main providers was introduced beginning with version [1.0.18](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-COM-PowerShell-Library/releases/tag/v1.0.18).

1. To create your HPE account for this library, go the HPE GreenLake interface at <https://common.cloud.hpe.com> and click on **Sign up**:

4. Click on the graphic that represents your Lab environment.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image8.png)

    Since Horizon is presenting a remote desktop session inside of your desktop's browser, it may be helpful to hit **F11** at this time to put the browser in full screen mode.

## Preparation of your environment 

1. You'll start by opening **Visual Studio Code** using the shortcut in the VM's desktop:

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image9.png)

2. Once opened, click on **Mark Done**:

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image10.png)

3. Start by opening a new file:

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image11.png)

    This new file will be useful to copy/paste all important information you find useful to keep an eye on.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image12.png)

4. Then open a PowerShell terminal using the **Terminal** menu / **New Terminal**: 

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image13.png)

    All the commands outlined in this lab guide should be executed in this window.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image14.png)

    You can use the shortcuts **CTRL**+**C** to copy and **CTRL**+**V** to paste the commands that are provided in this lab guide.

    > **⚠️ Important notes**
    > Ensure that each command line you copy and paste from the lab guide
    > into the Horizon session is pasted as a single line. Occasionally,
    > the paste action may introduce hidden characters, causing the
    > command to be interpreted as multiple lines by the target system.

5. While the PowerShell console is opened, you can optionally launch a browser to access the HPE GreenLake website and view the results of the commands you will be executing. If your browser is not already open and connected to HPE GreenLake, open a browser and navigate to <https://common.cloud.hpe.com>.

6. Login with your HPE account credentials:

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image15.png)

    If this is your first time using HPE GreenLake, it is expected that no workspace will be available in your environment. If you already have one or more workspaces, there is no issue; you can still proceed with this lab.

7. You can now leave the page and begin your zero-touch automation experience.

# Step 1 - How to Install HPECOMCmdlets
(Step 1 of 12) ⏱️ ~5 min

- The first step is to install the library on your Windows virtual machine. Return to the PowerShell console and enter the following command:

    ```powerShell
    Install-Module HPECOMCmdlets
    ```

    ![A black screen with white text Description automatically generated]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image16.png)

    This command will download and install the module from the official PowerShell Gallery repository. If this is your first time installing a module from the PowerShell Gallery, it will ask you to confirm whether you trust the repository or not. 
    
- Type **Y** when prompted and press **Enter** to continue with the installation.

    This library has no dependencies, so it does not require the installation of any other software or modules to function properly.


[⬆ Back to Top](#)

# Step 2 - Get the exported commands
(Step 2 of 12) ⏱️ ~3 min

- Now that the module is installed, you can get the list of commands exported by the module using:

    ```powerShell
    Get-Command -Module HPECOMCmdlets
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image17.png)

    Version **1.0.22** of the module includes over 200 cmdlets.

- In PowerShell, cmdlets use a verb-noun naming convention (e.g., **Get-HPECOMServer** retrieves server data in HPE Compute Ops
Management). Cmdlets start with **HPECOM** for Compute Ops Management or **HPEGL** for HPE GreenLake (e.g., **New-HPEGL**User*). The library supports both platforms due to their close integration.

- To list all cmdlets in the module related to server resources, use the following command:

    ```powerShell
    Get-Command -Module HPECOMCmdlets | ? name -match server
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image18.png)

    This command is especially helpful when you're dealing with many cmdlets and need to pinpoint the one that fits your needs best.

    >💡**Note**: **?** is an alias for **Where-Object** in PowerShell, and **-match** is the operator used to determine if a string matches a regular expression, such as **server** in this example.

- **Get-Help** cmdlet is another essential PowerShell command for locating information about new modules. To utilize this command,  enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Help Get-HPECOMserver -Full
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer program Description automatically generated](/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image19.png)

    **Get-Help** (or the alias **Help**) is a PowerShell cmdlet that allows you to retrieve information on other PowerShell cmdlets and functions. By running **Get-Help** in the PowerShell console, you can view detailed information about the specified cmdlet, including its syntax, parameters, examples, and related links. Additionally, you can use specific switches such as **-Detailed**, **-Examples**, or **-Full** to customize the output.

- Each cmdlet exported from this module provides detailed examples of how to use the command. To view the examples for the   **Get-HPECOMServer** cmdlet, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Help Get-HPECOMServer -Examples
    ```

    This will display a list of examples demonstrating how to use **Get-HPECOMServer** along with detailed explanations of what each
example does.

# Step 3 - Connection to HPE GreenLake
(Step 3 of 12) ⏱️ ~15 min

After the module is installed, the next first step is to connect to HPE GreenLake using the **Connect-HPEGL** command.

At this point, there are two authentication methods available:

- **Single or Multi-Factor Authentication** (MFA): Authenticate using your email and password, with optional MFA for added security.

- **SAML Single Sign-On (SSO):** SSO is exclusively supported with Okta, Entra ID, and PingID, providing efficient authentication aligned with your organization's SSO configuration. Please note that specific
  prerequisites must be met for this method, including the requirement for passwordless authentication methods such as push notifications or TOTP. For detailed guidance on configuring SSO and enabling   passwordless authentication, refer to [Configuring-SAML-SSO-with-HPE-GreenLake-and-Passwordless-Authentication-for-HPECOMCmdlets](https://jullienl.github.io/Configuring-SAML-SSO-with-HPE-GreenLake-and-Passwordless-Authentication-for-HPECOMCmdlets/)

Select the below option according to your user authentication method:

- **Using Single or Multi-Factor Authentication**:

  1. Begin by creating a credential object to securely store your HPE account credentials (email and password):

     ```PowerShell
     $MyEmail = "your_email@your_domain.com"
     $credentials = Get-Credential -UserName $MyEmail
     ```

  2. Once executed, the command prompts you for the password.
  
  3. Then use the credential object with the **Connect-HPEGL** command:

     ```PowerShell
     Connect-HPEGL -Credential $credentials
     ```

     ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image21.png)

      - When MFA is enabled with Okta:

        The cmdlet will prompt you to validate the push notification from Okta.

        ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image22.png)

        On your Okta-enabled device, press **Yes, it's me** to approve the authentication request.

         [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image23.png)]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image23.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}


      - When MFA is enabled with Google Authenticator:

        The cmdlet will pause and prompt you to enter the MFA token.

        ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image24.png)

        Open the Google Authenticator app on your device to retrieve the token and enter it when prompted.

- **Using SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) with Okta, PingID or Entra ID**:

  - Start by creating an email object:

    ```PowerShell
    $MyEmail = "your_email@your_domain.com"
    ```

  - To connect with SAML SSO through your organization's identity provider (IdP), enter the following command in your terminal:

    ```PowerShell
    Connect-HPEGL -SSOEmail $MyEmail
    ```

  Once initiated, the cmdlet will prompt you to approve a push notification sent by your IdP. Follow the on-screen authentication steps displayed in your terminal. Typically, you'll need to:

  - Check your IdP-enabled device for a push notification or authentication request.
  
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image25.png)

  - Approve the request (for example, tap the number or "Yes, it's me" in Okta or confirm in PingID/Entra ID).
  
    [![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image26.png)]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image26.png){:class="img-400"}{: data-lightbox="gallery"}

  - Complete any additional steps required by your organization's security policies.

Once authentication is successful, a secure connection to HPE GreenLake will be established, allowing you to proceed with subsequent operations.
The **Connect-HPEGL** cmdlet is responsible for initiating and managing this connection. Upon establishment, it maintains a persistent session using the **$HPEGreenLakeSession** connection tracker variable, which supports all further module cmdlet activities. Furthermore, the cmdlet issues a temporary API client credential for both HPE GreenLake and any Compute Ops Management service instances provisioned within your workspace.

> **💡 Note**
> You can use **Get-Help Connect-HPEGL -Full** to access the complete help documentation, technical details, and in-depth explanations for **Connect-HPEGL**.

If you have no workspace tied to your HPE account, the **Connect-HPEGL** command will return a warning message indicating that you need to create your first workspace:

![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image27.png)

If you already have one or more workspaces available, the command will return a warning message indicating that you need to use a second command to connect to one of the workspaces:

![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image28.png)

> **💡 Note**: The command to directly connect to an existing and known workspace (should not be used in this lab) is:
>
>  **Connect-HPEGL -Credential $credentials -Workspace "My_workspace_name"**


[⬆ Back to Top](#)

# Step 4 - Configuration of your workspace
(Step 4 of 12) ⏱️ ~20 min

## Task 1 -- Create your first workspace

1. To create your initial workspace (or an extra one just for this lab --- don't worry, it will be deleted once the lab ends), you need to provide a unique name. Since the name must be unique across all workspaces on the HPE GreenLake platform, we will use a random number to generate the name. Enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $WorkspaceName = "HPEWorkspaceTxx_$(Get-Random)"
    ```

    With **xx**, your team number. This command generates a name such as *HPEWorkspaceT01_12345678* for team 1. You can verify your workspace name by executing **$WorkspaceName**.

    > **⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE !!**  
    > You must follow this specified naming convention exactly to ensure that our lab reset scripts function properly at the end of this session. Your strict adherence is required.

2. Next, type the following command using your own parameters:

    **New-HPEGLWorkspace -Name $WorkspaceName -Type** <Press the tab key and select 'Standard enterprise workspace'>
    
    **-Country** <Press the tab key to get the list of supported countries and select one>
    
    **-Street** "A street address"

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image29.png)

      
    If you encounter any difficulties while creating your workspace, use this example below:
    
    ```PowerShell
    New-HPEGLWorkspace -Name $WorkspaceName -Type 'Standard enterprise workspace' -Street "Street address" -Country Canada
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image29.png)

    >  **💡 Note**: The **Tab** key activates the auto-completion feature, which presents available property values for selection. This function enhances efficiency and accuracy by reducing manual entry errors and saving time.

    >  **📌 Note**: In the example above, only the **name**, **type**, **country**, and **street** parameters are included because they are required. However, you can also specify optional parameters like **city**, **state**, **email**, and others.

3. After executing this command, the workspace is created, and the command automatically disconnects the session. To connect to your new workspace, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Connect-HPEGL -Credential $credentials -Workspace $WorkspaceName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image30.png)


4. To check the content of your workspace, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLWorkspace
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image31.png)


## Task 2 -- Add a user to your workspace

There are several commands that are available to configure a workspace and the different resources available in a workspace, such as adding users, settings roles, location, etc. In this task, you will simply add
a new user with a specific role.

1. Invite **admin@hpelabs.us** as an administrator to your newly created workspace:

    ```PowerShell
    $NewUserEmail = "admin@hpelabs.us"
    New-HPEGLUser -Email $NewUserEmail -RoleName 'Workspace Administrator'
    ```

    > **⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE !!**  
    > It is essential to add this admin user so that the lab reset scripts operate as intended at the conclusion of this session. Thank you for your cooperation.


2. To verify the new user, execute the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLUser
    ```

## Task 3 -- Provision Compute Ops Management

The following step involves setting up services. There are several kinds of services you can provision across different regions.

1. To see all available services, use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLService -ShowUnprovisioned
    ```

    This command lists all unprovisioned services, including those for networking devices (HPE Aruba Networking Central), compute devices (Compute Ops Management), storage devices (Data Services), OpsRamp, etc.

    The **ProvisionStatus** column will indicate UNPROVISIONED for each listed service. You can choose to provision any of these, as long as you have the needed permissions.

2. In this lab exercise, you'll set up the Compute Ops Management (COM) service in the European central region. Enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $Region = "eu-central"
    New-HPEGLService -Name "Compute Ops Management" -Region $Region
    ```

    > **💡 Note**: Additional regions are available; to view different supported regions, use:  
    > **Get-HPEGLService -Name "Compute Ops Management"**

3. To confirm that the COM instance is provisioned, run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLService -ShowProvisioned
    ```

4. Next, assign the 'Administrator' role for Compute Ops Management to both you and the invited user:

    ```PowerShell
    $MyEmail, $NewUserEmail | Add-HPEGLRoleToUser -RoleName 'Compute Ops Management administrator'
    ```

    > **💡 Note**: The **Tab** key can be used to display the available list of role names.

5. Finally, verify the role assignments with:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLUserRole -Email $MyEmail
    Get-HPEGLUserRole -Email $NewUserEmail
    ```

## Task 4 -- Set a location

Locations in Service Delivery Information (SDI) store addresses, contacts, and support details for automation. Assigning a device to a location links it physically for automated support, including ticket creation with HPE.

This step is essential for automatically creating a ticket with HPE support.

1. To create a location, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $LocationName = "Your_customized_location_name"
    New-HPEGLLocation -Name $LocationName -Description "Your customized description" -Country "Your country" -Street "Your customized street address" -City $LocationName -State "NA" -PostalCode "123456789" -PrimaryContactEmail $MyEmail
    ```

    > **💡 Note**: You can press the **Tab** key after typing **-Country** to view all supported countries.


2. Check the location with:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLLocation
    ```

## Task 5 - Add a subscription to your workspace

1. To activate compute devices that will be added later to your workspace, you need to add a COM subscription key. Enter:

    ```PowerShell
    New-HPEGLSubscription -SubscriptionKey "<key found in the login sheet>"
    ```

2. To check the subscription, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLSubscription
    ```

3. Workspaces have two subscription management options:

    - **Assignment**: Controls automatic subscription assignment when devices are added.

    - **Re-assignment**: Controls if subscriptions are reassigned when one expires or is canceled. Note that auto-reassignment is enabled by default for all device types. 

    To retrieve these options, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLDeviceAutoSubscription
    Get-HPEGLDeviceAutoReassignSubscription
    ```

4. Set the automatic subscription assignment for Compute:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-HPEGLDeviceAutoSubscription -ComputeSubscriptionTier ENHANCED
    ```

    > **💡 Note:** Auto-reassignment is enabled by default for all device types; therefore, manual configuration of automatic subscription
    > re-assignment for Compute devices is generally unnecessary. For reference, you may enable it manually using  
    > **Set-HPEGLDeviceAutoReassignSubscription -Computes** if it was previously disabled with **Remove-HPEGLDeviceAutoReassignSubscription.**

# Step 5 - Onboarding devices 
(Step 5 of 12) ⏱️ ~15 min

You can add devices to a workspace either one at a time or in bulk.
Another option is to use a COM activation key, which lets you add single
or multiple compute devices directly to a Compute Ops Management (COM)
instance. In this lab, you'll be using that specific method.

> **🎯 Note**: For onboarding multiple servers, use the [HPE Compute Ops
> Management Onboarding
> Script](https://github.com/jullienl/HPE-Compute-Ops-Management/tree/main/PowerShell/Onboarding).
> This PowerShell tool automates connecting HPE servers to COM, applies
> activation keys, and sets up initial iLO configurations (DNS, NTP,
> tags, location, firmware/compliance policies). It also manages
> authentication, device registration, and early configuration for a
> streamlined "zero-touch" setup.

## Task 1 - Onboard one server

1. To generate an activation key for connecting your server to the Compute Ops Management instance in the region you provisioned earlier, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    $Activation_Key = New-HPECOMServerActivationKey -Region $Region
    ```

    This command should be used in conjunction with the **-Region** parameter, consistent with other HPECOM cmdlets, to specify the COM instance---that is, the region where the COM instance is provisioned and where the command will be executed. Please note that the auto-completion tab can be utilized to display the available region codes provisioned within your workspace.

    > **🔔 Note:** This method is supported only for the following iLO versions:  
    > - iLO 5: Version 3.09 or later  
    > - iLO 6: Version 1.64 or later
    > - iLO 7: Version 1.12.00 or later 

2. To see the activation key that has been generated, you can enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $Activation_key
    ```

    > **💡 Note**: No subscription key is needed with this command because
    > auto-subscription for Compute has been enabled earlier using
    > **Set-HPEGLDeviceAutoSubscription**.

3. Next, assign the IP address of your iLO to a variable by entering the
following command. Be sure to use the IP address listed in the login
sheet provided by your instructor. Enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $iLO_IP = "xx.xx.xx.xxx"
    ```

4. And assign the password of your iLO, also found in the login sheet to another variable:

    ```PowerShell
    $iLO_Password = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```
    
5. Then execute the following commands to connect the iLO to the COM instance using the activation key that was generated earlier:

    ```PowerShell
    $iLO_SecurePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $iLO_Password -AsPlainText -Force
    $iLO_credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("Administrator", $iLO_SecurePassword)
    Connect-HPEGLDeviceComputeiLOtoCOM -iLOCredential $iLO_credential -IloIP $iLO_IP -ActivationKeyfromCOM $Activation_Key -SkipCertificateValidation
    ```

    > **💡 Note**: The **SkipCertificateValidation** parameter bypasses
    > all certificate validation steps, including checks for expiration,
    > revocation, and trusted root authority. This approach is insecure
    > and generally discouraged. It should only be used with known hosts

    > scenario.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image32.png)

    > 💡 **Note**: The **Connect-HPEGLDeviceComputeiLOtoCOM** cmdlet provides additional parameters to connect iLO through a COM Secure Gateway or through a web proxy.

    > **💡Note**: In scenarios involving a Secure Gateway (**not applicable to this lab**), the commands would be as follows:
    > 1. Obtain a valid subscription key:  
    > ```PowerShel
    > $SubscriptionKey = Get-HPEGLSubscription -ShowWithAvailableQuantity -ShowValid -FilterBySubscriptionType Server | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty key
    > ```
    > 2. Retrieve the Secure Gateway object:  
    > ```PowerShel
    > $SG = Get-HPECOMAppliance -Region $Region -Name sg01.domain.com
    > ```
    > 3. Create a Secure Gateway activation key:  
    > ```PowerShel
    > $Activation_Key = New-HPECOMServerActivationKey -Region $Region -SecureGateway $SG -SubscriptionKey $SubscriptionKey
    > ```
    > 4. Use the Secure Gateway activation key to connect the iLO to COM and set the Secure Gateway as the iLO's proxy server:  
    > ```PowerShel
    > Connect-HPEGLDeviceComputeiLOtoCOM -iLOCredential $iLO_credential -IloIP "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" -ActivationKeyfromCOM $Activation_Key -SkipCertificateValidation -IloProxyServer sg01.domain.com -IloProxyPort 8080
    > ```

6. You can then verify the onboarded servers using the following cmdlet:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLDevice
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image33.png)

    > **💡 Note**: This method not only automatically assigns servers to
    > the COM service instance but also automatically applies a
    > subscription key to the devices.

7. As the device has been automatically assigned to your COM instance with a subscription key, you are now able to utilize COM cmdlets. For instance, you may use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image34.png)

    Note that the output differs slightly from the output of the **Get-HPEGLDevice** command. It adds additional information such as the power state, the connected state, the iLO IP address, and more. However, always remember that the output is a formatted view and does not show the entire content of the returned object. To get the full details, you need to pipe the command to **\| Format-List** (or **\| fl**) at the end.

8. To determine the number of remaining licenses, execute the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -ShowSubscriptionDetails
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image35.png)

9. Before proceeding with the next steps in the lab, ensure that your server is powered on by checking the **PowerState** column in the output above. If the server is not **ON**, run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region | Start-HPECOMServer
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image36.png)

    This command will power on all servers managed by COM. Since you currently have only one server onboarded, it will specifically start that device.

## Task 2 -- Set device location and tags

1. Next you need to set the device location. As indicated earlier, this step is important to ensure that support cases are automatically created in the event of device failures. To do so, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLdevice | Set-HPEGLDeviceLocation -LocationName $LocationName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image37.png)

2. To verify that the location has been correctly assigned to your device, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLdevice
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image38.png)

    > **📝 Note**: Expand the PowerShell console to its maximum width to ensure that you can see the Location property in the output.

3. Next, you can assign tags to your device. A tag is a form of metadata that uses a key-value pair (e.g., App=AI) and can be applied to any resource. Tags are primarily used to categorize resources based on purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

    > **ℹ️ Note**: Tags are particularly important for extending filtering
    > capabilities and enhancing the use of scope-based access control,
    > which allows you to limit users' abilities to perform actions on a
    > selected list of resources. These resources can be categorized based
    > on various criteria, such as generation, model, groups, and most
    > importantly, tags.

4. Add two tags to your device: one for country location and one for AI application type. Use this command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLDevice | Add-HPEGLDeviceTagToDevice -Tags "Country=FR, App=AI"
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image39.png)

5. To verify that the tags have been correctly assigned to your device, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLdevice -ShowTags
    ```

# Step 6 - Configuration of Compute Ops Management
(Step 6 of 12) ⏱️ ~25 min

The following step involves setting up Compute Ops Management. This
process includes various tasks like setting up server configurations,
forming groups, assigning servers to these groups and much more. The
steps to complete this setup are outlined below:

## Task 1 -- Create server settings

A setting in COM is a collection of parameters that you can apply to one
or more servers through groups. These settings include parameters such
as BIOS, internal storage, firmware, OS, etc.

### Server Bios Settings

Server BIOS Settings allow you to create a new BIOS configuration for
servers using either a workload profile or custom parameters, ensuring
consistent settings across server groups. The
**New-HPECOMSettingServerBios** cmdlet provides many options; for
details on available parameters and how they behave with different iLO
versions and server generations, refer to the help section of the
cmdlet.

> **ℹ️ Note**: Server BIOS settings can't be managed from the UI---they
> can only be created today through the COM API using the
> **New-HPECOMSettingServerBios** cmdlet.

1. To create a bios setting with a few customized options, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $BiosSettingName = "Custom-Bios-For-AI"
    New-HPECOMSettingServerBios -Region $Region -Name $BiosSettingName -WorkloadProfileName  "Virtualization - Max Performance" -AsrStatus:$True -AsrTimeoutMinutes Timeout10
    ```

    This command creates a new BIOS setting configuration tailored for virtualization with maximum performance. It also enables the Automatic Server Recovery (ASR) feature and sets the timeout for the ASR feature to 10 minutes.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image41.png)

2. To verify the newly created BIOS setting, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSetting -Region $Region -Name $BiosSettingName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image42.png)

### Server Internal Storage Settings

These settings allow you to configure a new server storage setup with different volumes using selected RAID type and size, ensuring uniform storage across groups.

3. To configure for example a configuration with two volumes: OS on RAID1 with two SAS drives, and data on RAID5 with three SSDs plus two spares, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $InternalStorageSettingName = "RAID-Configuration-for-AI-Servers"
    $volume1 = New-HPECOMSettingServerInternalStorageVolume -RAID RAID5 -DriveTechnology  NVME_SSD -IOPerformanceMode ENABLED -ReadCachePolicy OFF -WriteCachePolicy  WRITE_THROUGH -SizeinGB 100 -DrivesNumber 3 -SpareDriveNumber 2
    $volume2 = New-HPECOMSettingServerInternalStorageVolume -RAID RAID1 -DriveTechnology  SAS_HDD
    New-HPECOMSettingServerInternalStorage -Region $Region -Name $InternalStorageSettingName -Volumes $volume1, $volume2 -Description "RAID1 and RAID5 server settings for AI systems"
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image43.png)

4. To verify the newly created internal storage setting, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSetting -Region $Region -Name $InternalStorageSettingName
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image44.png)

5. To verify the two volumes that are defined:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSetting -Region $Region -Name $InternalStorageSettingName -ShowVolumes
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image45.png)

### Server Firmware Settings

These settings allow you to set baselines for updating server firmware,
helping maintain consistent firmware versions across groups of servers.

6. To set up firmware, start by finding the latest baseline for the relevant generation using:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMFirmwareBaseline -Region $Region -Generation 11 -LatestVersion
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image46.png)

7. To create the firmware setting with the latest baselines for both Gen10 and Gen11, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $FirmwareSettingName = "Latest-Firmware-Baselines-for-AI"
    $Gen10_Firmware_Baseline = Get-HPECOMFirmwareBaseline -Region $Region -LatestVersion -Generation 10 | select -ExpandProperty releaseVersion
    $Gen11_Firmware_Baseline = Get-HPECOMFirmwareBaseline -Region $Region -LatestVersion -Generation 11 | select -ExpandProperty releaseVersion
    New-HPECOMSettingServerFirmware -Region $Region -Name $FirmwareSettingName -Description "FW baseline for AI servers" -Gen10FirmwareBaselineReleaseVersion $Gen10_Firmware_Baseline -Gen11FirmwareBaselineReleaseVersion $Gen11_Firmware_Baseline
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image47.png)

8. To verify the newly created firmware setting, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSetting -Region $Region -Name $FirmwareSettingName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image48.png)

### iLO Settings

ILO settings enable the configuration of specific parameters to standardize iLO management across server groups. These settings support a range of options, including network protocols, SNMP, user accounts, security features, and update services. The **New-HPECOMSettingiLOSettings** cmdlet provides many options; for details on available parameters, refer to the help section of the cmdlet.

1. To configure iLO settings, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $iLOSettingName = "AI_iLO_Settings"
    New-HPECOMSettingiLOSettings -Region $Region -Name $iLOSettingName -Description "iLO Settings for AI Servers" -VirtualMedia Enabled -PasswordComplexity Enabled -WebServerSSL Enabled -AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates Disabled
    ```
    
    This command activates iLO virtual media, enforces password complexity, enables HTTPS, and disables third-party firmware updates.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image49.png)

2. To verify the newly created iLO settings, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSetting -Region $Region -Name $iLOSettingName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image50.png)

## Task 2 -- Create a group

In this task you will create a new group incorporating the different settings created earlier. Groups enable you to organize your servers into custom-defined sets for easier monitoring and manageability. The server-related settings and policies you created earlier can be applied to a single group, as you will do in this lab, or to multiple groups as needed.

1. To create a new group, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $GroupName = "AI_Group"
    New-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -Description "My new group for AI servers"  -BiosSettingName $BiosSettingName -AutoBiosApplySettingsOnAdd:$false -iLOSettingName $iLOSettingName -AutoIloApplySettingsOnAdd:$true -FirmwareSettingName $FirmwareSettingName -AutoFirmwareUpdateOnAdd:$false -PowerOffServerAfterFirmwareUpdate:$false -FirmwareDowngrade:$false -StorageSettingName $InternalStorageSettingName -AutoStorageVolumeCreationOnAdd:$false -AutoStorageVolumeDeletionOnAdd:$false -TagUsedForAutoAddServer "App=AI"
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image51.png)

    This command creates the new group "AI_Group" with previously configured BIOS, firmware, storage, and iLO settings. Additionally, the command specifies whether certain actions, such as applying settings or creating storage volumes, should be automated when servers are added to the group. These are called group policies. The "App=AI" tag is defined so that any server with this tag during onboarding will automatically be added to this group.

    > **💡 Note**: The server operating system image setting is not used
    > in this command but is another setting that can be utilized to
    > install the operating system using an ISO image and optionally a
    > kickstart file.

2. To verify the newly created group, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image52.png)

    Note that, as configured earlier, 4 settings are applied to that group.

3. To display the settings list, type:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowSettings
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image53.png)

4. Additionally, you may review the policies currently assigned to the group by using the following:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowPolicies
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image54.png)

    Keep in mind that only the iLO settings take effect right away after you add servers to the group.

## Task 3 -- Add servers to the group

The next task is to add your server to the new group. According to the group policies, only the iLO settings will be applied immediately upon adding the servers to the group. 

1. To assign all servers (in this instance, only one server) to the newly created group, proceed as follows:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region | Add-HPECOMServerToGroup -GroupName $GroupName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image55.png)

2. To verify that the new server has been added to the group, enter the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowMembers
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image56.png)

3. To monitor the progress of active related group jobs, execute the following command at regular intervals:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -Category Group -ShowRunning
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image57.png)

    This command shows all the running jobs associated with the group category.

    > **📝 Note**: Each time a server is added to a group that includes
    > firmware or iLO settings, an automatic process is initiated. This
    > process triggers a group firmware compliance report job and a group
    > iLO settings compliance job to ensure the servers meet the
    > requirements of the associated firmware baselines and iLO settings.

4. To review the related server jobs that are presently active, execute the command multiple times:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -Category Server -ShowRunning
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image58.png)

    This command lists active jobs for the server category, focusing on the "add to group" action.

5. Once all jobs have finished running, execute the command below to check their status:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image59.png)

    > **📝 Note**: Compute Ops Management tracks iLO settings and compares
    > them to the desired configuration. Whenever iLO changes are
    > detected, Compute Ops Management automatically verifies compliance.

6. You can check the compliance status of firmware and ILO settings in several ways, such as by using **Get-HPECOMGroup** or **Get-HPECOMServer**. To verify the group compliance, use the following method:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowCompliance
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image60.png)

    This command generates a comprehensive compliance status report for all types, including firmware, iLO settings, and external storage. Notably, the iLO settings status is 'COMPLIANT,' which confirms that the group-defined iLO settings have been properly implemented on the iLO.

    > **📝 Note**: The COM API does not track BIOS settings compliance.
    > This is why you only see these three compliance types in the cmdlets

    > **💡 Note:** **Get-HPECOMServer** includes several parameters **-ShowGroupCompliance**, **-ShowGroupiLOSettingsCompliance**, or **-ShowGroupFirmwareCompliance**---that allow you to directly check compliance on a specified server.

# Step 7 - Gathering Comprehensive Server Inventory Information
(Step 7 of 12) ⏱️ ~5 min

Keeping accurate server inventory is crucial for effective IT
management---it enables quick troubleshooting, ensures compliance, and
helps identify issues before they escalate. Compute Ops Management
streamlines this by automatically collecting and updating detailed
server inventory, so administrators always have the latest information
on hand.

To obtain detailed server inventory information, use the
**Get-HPECOMServerInventory** cmdlet along with the
**-Name** parameter. The **-Name** parameter accepts either the server's
name or its serial number, allowing you to specify the server from which
you wish to retrieve inventory data.

1. But before that, capture the serial number of your server to facilitate all subsequent commands, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $SN = Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SerialNumber
    ```

2. Then to generate a detailed memory report of your server using the **$SN** variable, run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServerInventory -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowMemory
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image61.png)

3. Additional reporting options are available via the same command, like for a report on the CPU:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServerInventory -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowProcessor
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image62.png)

    There are several **-Show** commands for different server inventory data. For efficiency, type **-Show** and press **CTRL**+**SPACE** to view all property options or use **Tab** for auto-completion.

    > **💡 Note**: Running **-ShowSoftware** may return no data if your
    > server's operating system or HPE Agentless Management Service (AMS)
    > is not installed or running. Same with **-ShowSmartUpdateTool** if SUT
    > is not installed and running.

    > 💡 **Note**: If it is necessary to initiate the collection of server
    > inventory data (for example, if existing data may be outdated), the
    > following command can be used to force a hardware inventory
    > collection:
    > ```PowerShell
    > Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region | New-HPECOMServerInventory -Async
    > ```
    > The **-Async** parameter allows the cmdlet to return the asynchronous
    > job resource immediately. By default, the cmdlet will wait for the job
    > to finish before returning.

# Step 8 - Monitoring Server Health, Support, and Warranty Status
(Step 8 of 12) ⏱️ ~10 min

One of the key responsibilities in server management is troubleshooting
issues, managing open cases, monitoring server health, and ensuring that
servers remain under warranty coverage. In Step 8, effective server
management includes tasks such as confirming operational status,
reviewing health summaries, monitoring current activities and alerts,
retrieving support details and cases, and identifying servers with
recent support incidents for proactive maintenance. The
**Get-HPECOMServer** cmdlet, along with its related inventory and job
parameters, provides a comprehensive toolkit for these tasks.
Specifically, you can:

- Check overall server health and component status (fans, memory,
  network, power supplies, processor, storage, temperature, BIOS, health
  LEDs) using **-ShowHealthStatus**.

- Review current activities and alerts with **-ShowActivities** and
  **-ShowAlerts**.

- Retrieve detailed support information and warranty details using
  **-ShowSupportDetails**.

- Manage and track open support cases with **-ShowSupportCases**, and
  identify servers with recent support cases via
  -**ShowServersWithRecentSupportCases**.

- Review recent jobs performed on the server using -ShowJobs.

These features collectively enable robust monitoring, efficient
troubleshooting, and proactive resolution of server issues, ensuring
optimal server performance and support coverage.

## Task 1 -- Getting server health status, activities, jobs and alerts

The first step in server troubleshooting is to confirm that the server is operational and verify the absence of any active alerts. 

1. To review your server's health status, execute the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowHealthStatus
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image63.png)

2. To retrieve the list of activities from the past month on your server, you can use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowActivities
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image64.png)

    > You can use the dedicated cmdlet **Get-HPECOMActivity -Region $Region -SourceName $SN** to retrieve COM activities, which offers enhanced options such as filtering by time, category, or source name.

3. To retrieve all alerts associated with your server, use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowAlerts
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image65.png)

    > Alerts provide security information and issues related to servers. By
    > default, all alerts associated with your server are returned. You can
    > use the dedicated cmdlet **Get-HPECOMAlert** to get more options and
    > filters.

4. You may receive some returned alerts with a less-than-ideal output view. To view different properties, consider running:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowAlerts | Format-List
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image66.png)

5. To obtain a comprehensive list of jobs associated with your server for the last month, including their current state "PENDING" (waiting to start), "RUNNING" (in progress), "STALLED" (stuck), "ERROR" (failed), or "COMPLETE" (finished successfully), you can run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowJobs
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image67.png)

    > You can also utilize the specialized cmdlet **Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -SourceName $SN** to retrieve a list of jobs associated with a specific source name. By default, this command returns jobs from the past seven days, but you can broaden your search using parameters like **-ShowLastMonth** to include the previous month or **-ShowAll** for the complete job history. Additionally, you have the option to filter results to display only jobs that are currently running with **-ShowRunning**, or to show only jobs that are waiting in the queue by using **-ShowPending**.

6. Please be advised that to obtain the list of jobs related to your group, you may use the following method:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -SourceName $GroupName
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image68.png)

7. If you need to view detailed job information or troubleshoot specific tasks, you can refine your queries further by using additional parameters. For example, to quickly identify and analyze the most recent job that has failed, you can target your search accordingly:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region | Where-Object resultCode -eq FAILURE | Select-Object -First 1 | Format-List
    ```

    This flexibility helps in managing and monitoring server operations more effectively, especially in large or complex environments.

## Task 2 -- Getting server support details

The subsequent phase in server troubleshooting involves verifying the
support details. This information is crucial for determining warranty
status and its duration.

1. To make sure the server is still supported, you can run.

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowSupportDetails
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image69.png)

    > **⚠️ Note**: Your assigned lab server may not have a support contract warranty.

2. You can use the following command to verify whether COM has automatically created a support case:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowSupportCases
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image70.png)

    Note that if no support cases are found for the specified server, the cmdlet returns no output.

    > **💡 Note**: **Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -ShowServersWithRecentSupportCases** can be used to list servers with recent support cases.

## Task 3 -- Collecting and downloading server logs

When encountering a critical server issue, HPE support may request the
collection and submission of your server's Active Health System (AHS)
logs for deeper analysis. Traditionally, gathering these logs can be a
complex and time-consuming task. Fortunately, the provided module
streamlines this process by offering a straightforward method to collect
server logs for any specified server, making troubleshooting more
efficient and accessible.

1. To initiate the collection and download of server logs, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServerLogs -Region $Region -Name $SN -DownloadAHSLogs -Path .
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image71.png)

    > The **-DownloadAHSLogs** parameter enables you to include Active
    > Health System (AHS) logs along with the regular server logs. AHS logs
    > offer extensive diagnostic information that HPE support often asks for
    > when investigating hardware problems or reviewing support cases. These
    > logs give detailed insights into hardware health and performance.
    > Normally, only standard server logs are gathered, so activate this
    > option if HPE support requests AHS logs specifically for case
    > analysis.
    >   
    >   
    > The **-Path** parameter allows you to specify the destination folder
    > for the downloaded server logs. In the example above, we used a single
    > period "." to indicate the current directory, so the logs will be
    > saved locally. Since no custom filename was provided, the module
    > automatically creates a file named in the format

    > identify and organize logs for different servers and collection times.
    > Please note that the log collection process may require 2 to 4 minutes
    > to complete, as it compiles comprehensive diagnostic data from the
    > server.

2. Once the task completes, the zip file can be found using:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-ChildItem -Path . -Filter *.zip | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image72.png)

3. If you want to see what's inside, you can use Windows Explorer to open the zip file:

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image73.png)

4. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell's built-in **Expand-Archive** cmdlet to extract the contents of the zip file. Simply run the following by replacing the angle brackets with your server name, timestamp and destination folder:

    ```PowerShell
    Expand-Archive -Path .server-logs-**< server name >**-**<timestamp >**.zip -DestinationPath .**<folder name>
    ```

    This makes it easy to inspect individual log files and share relevant data with support teams for further troubleshooting.

## Task 4 -- Enabling email notification

An essential aspect of effective server management is receiving timely
alerts when issues arise. To address this, COM provides configurable
email notification policies for each service instance as well as for
individual servers. In this step, you will establish an email
notification policy at the COM instance level, ensuring that whenever a
server is added to COM, the preferred email notification settings are
automatically applied.

1. To subscribe your user account to receive email notifications, including service events, critical or warning severity events, and daily summary updates, execute the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Enable-HPECOMEmailNotificationPolicy -Region $Region -DailySummary -ServiceEventAndCriticalAndWarningIssues
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image74.png)

    > **📝 Note:** A service event refers to a failure that requires the creation of an HPE support case and may necessitate a service repair.

2. To review the current status of the email notification policy, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMEmailNotificationPolicy -Region $Region
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image75.png)

# Step 9 - Updating and Ensuring Server Firmware Compliance
(Step 9 of 12) ⏱️ ~10 min

This section outlines the procedures for configuring key server
management functions in COM. It covers maintaining server firmware
compliance to uphold security and performance standards, reviewing group
firmware deviations, and scheduling group firmware updates. Adhering to
these steps will enhance the efficiency of monitoring and maintaining
your server infrastructure.

## Task 1 -- Checking group firmware compliance 

The initial step in this process is to verify your group's firmware
compliance status. This compliance report provides a clear assessment of
how closely your servers align with the firmware baseline established
for your group. Not only does it indicate the number of components that
are out of compliance, but it also offers a detailed
breakdown---including the total download size required for all necessary
firmware updates. This comprehensive view is essential for understanding
the scope of updates needed and for planning any remediation actions
efficiently.

1. To check your group's current firmware compliance status, run this command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowFirmwareCompliance
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image76.png)

    This command returns the following properties for the server:

    - **Server**: Server name

    - **SerialNumber**: Server serial number

    - **Group**: Group name the server belongs to

    - **State**: Compliance state (Compliant, Not Compliant, Unknown, etc.)

    - **Score**: Compliance score percentage (e.g., 25% indicates 25% compliant)

    - **ErrorReason**: Reason for compliance failure if applicable

    - **Criticality**: Severity level of the firmware update (Recommended, Critical, Optional)

    - **Deviations**: Number of firmware components that deviate from the group's baseline

    - **WillItRebootTheServer**: Indicates if applying the update will reboot the server (Yes/No)

    - **GracefullShutdownAttempt**: Indicates if a graceful shutdown will be attempted before reboot (Yes/No)

    - **TotalDownloadSize**: Total size of firmware updates to download (e.g., 65 MB)

    These properties describe the firmware compliance status of each group member. COM calculates the group compliance status by analyzing the group members for adherence to the server firmware settings configured in the group.

    > **🔔 Note:** You may achieve a perfect 100% compliance score with no deviations depending on the status of your allocated server.

## Task 2 -- Checking group firmware deviations

Before updating the server firmware, you can examine any deviations in
firmware components from your group's established baseline. This step
allows you to accurately identify which specific components require
updates to align with the group definition. The components identified
for update correspond to the total firmware size of 65 MB, as indicated
in the TotalDownloadSize column of the firmware compliance report.

1. To view your group's firmware deviations, use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN -ShowGroupFirmwareDeviation
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image77.png)

    This command returns the following properties for each firmware component that deviates:

    - **ComponentName**: Name of the firmware component (e.g., System ROM, NIC, Boot Controller)

    - **ExpectedVersion**: Firmware version expected by the group's baseline

    - **InstalledVersion**: Currently installed firmware version on the server

    - **ComponentFilename**: Filename of the firmware update package  
   

> ⚠️ **Note:** If there are no deviations, this command will not return any response.  

> 🔔 **Note:** The Firmware Compliance feature does not monitor HPE driver and software versions.

## Task 3 -- Scheduling group firmware update

After identifying the firmware deviation within the group definition,
you may choose to perform a group firmware update. For this exercise,
however, you will instead create a scheduled task to initiate the
firmware update for all servers in your group during the upcoming
weekend (in four days).

> 🎯 **Note:** A live group firmware update will not be performed in
> this lab because of time constraints and the potential impact on
> servers used by other sessions. Thank you for your understanding.

1. To create a scheduled firmware update task, you need to use the **Update-HPECOMGroupFirmware** cmdlet with the **-ScheduleTime** parameter as shown below:

    ```PowerShell
    Update-HPECOMGroupFirmware -Region $Region -GroupName $GroupName -AllowFirmwareDowngrade -InstallHPEDriversAndSoftware -ScheduleTime (Get-Date).AddDays(4)
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image78.png)

    This update, scheduled in four days, allows firmware downgrades and installs HPE drivers and software.

    > **📝 Note**: To benefit from HPE's drivers and software update
    > functionality, always make sure your servers fulfill the required
    > [prerequisites](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=sd00004003en_us&page=GUID-7D3436DF-F986-4910-AAC6-685CD5639A3F.html#ariaid-title1).

2. To list all scheduled tasks, you can use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSchedule -Region $Region
    ```

    There are several other important parameters with the **Update-HPECOMGroupFirmware**:

    The **ServerSerialNumber** parameter allows you to update only a
    specific server within the group instead of updating all servers in the
    group at once. Testing firmware updates on an individual server prior to
    deploying them across the entire group is a recommended best practice.

    By default, **Update-HPECOMGroupFirmware** runs updates in parallel
    across eligible servers. The **SerialUpdates** parameter ensures that
    only one server in the group updates at a time. This prevents all
    servers from being offline simultaneously. When you combine
    **SerialUpdates** with **StopOnFailure**, the update process stops
    immediately if any server fails the firmware update, preventing further
    servers from being updated until you investigate the issue.

    The **PowerOffAfterUpdate** parameter automatically powers off servers
    after a successful firmware update, which can be useful for data center
    maintenance schedules or when you want to perform physical maintenance.

    The **DisablePrerequisiteCheck** parameter bypasses prerequisite
    validation checks before the update starts. Use this parameter only in
    trusted environments where you have already verified that all
    prerequisites are met, as skipping these checks can lead to failed
    updates.

    The **SkipComponentUpdatesThatAreBlockedByKnownIssues** parameter
    automatically avoids updating specific firmware components that are
    known to cause problems or issues in your environment.

    The **Async** parameter returns control to your PowerShell prompt
    immediately without waiting for the firmware update to complete. This is
    useful when you want to schedule multiple operations or continue with
    other tasks while the firmware updates run in the background.

# Step 10 - Essential Next Steps for Server Management and Sustainability
(Step 10 of 12) ⏱️ ~15 min

After completing setup and firmware updates, the next essential steps
focus on ongoing server management and sustainability. Use HPE Compute
Ops Management PowerShell cmdlets to monitor server performance and
sustainability, generate utilization insights, and review energy
reports. Streamline authentication for accessing iLO interfaces by
implementing Single Sign-On (SSO), and confirm that your COM
configuration of iLO settings is correct through practical verification.

## Task 1 -- Server utilization insights

Server utilization insights play a crucial role in optimizing data
center efficiency and sustainability. Leveraging AI-powered analytics,
these insights provide detailed visibility into key performance metrics
such as CPU usage, memory utilization, bus activity, and I/O bus
performance. By continuously monitoring and analyzing server workloads,
administrators can proactively identify bottlenecks, balance resource
allocation, and make informed decisions to maximize both performance and
energy efficiency.

By default, COM automatically enables metrics data collection and
utilization alerts. This feature allows COM to gather essential metrics
for generating sustainability AI insights, creating utilization reports,
and issuing utilization alerts. 

1. To check the current configuration status, you can run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMMetricsConfiguration -Region $Region
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image79.png)

    COM metrics provides information on CPU, memory bus, and I/O bus usage. These insights help organizations monitor and manage the performance of their server infrastructure.

2. To view detailed CPU utilization insights for your server, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServerUtilizationInsights -Region $Region -SerialNumber $SN -CPUUtilization
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image80.png)


    > **⚠️ Note**: Please be advised that server utilization insights are only for HPE ProLiant **Intel** based servers and the utilization insight data might **not** be available at this time.
    >    
    > ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image81.png)  
    >    
    > Since your server was only recently added to the COM instance, a minimum of one day is required for sufficient data collection. The screenshot is included to illustrate the anticipated output of the cmdlets after several days of data collection.

3. By default, this cmdlet provides CPU utilization data for the past 90 days. If you want to customize the reporting period, add the **LookbackDays** parameter. For example, to see CPU utilization insights for the last 7 days, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMServerUtilizationInsights -Region $Region -SerialNumber $SN -CPUUtilization -LookbackDays 7
    ```

    The cmdlet also offers several important metrics:

    - MemoryBusUtilization

    - IOBusUtilization

    - CPUInterconnectUtilization

    > These measurements give a broad view of your server's resource usage,
    > allowing you to make smart choices that boost performance and
    > efficiency.

## Task 2 -- Server sustainability insights

The Server Sustainability Insights feature is essential for enhancing
data center efficiency and promoting environmentally responsible
operations. In today's landscape, where sustainability is increasingly
prioritized, it's critical to monitor and optimize energy usage across
server infrastructure. Compute Ops Management (COM) offers comprehensive
sustainability insights by providing detailed reports on energy
consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and associated energy
costs.

These three report types---covering energy consumption, CO2 emissions,
and cost savings---empower organizations to assess, track, and manage
the environmental impact of their servers. With these insights, IT teams
can make data-driven decisions to reduce their carbon footprint and
operational expenses.

1. To access in-depth energy consumption data for a specific server, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSustainabilityInsights -Region $Region -SerialNumber $SN -EnergyConsumption
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image82.png)

    By default, similar to the server utilization insights, this cmdlet provides the total estimated figures for the previous 90 days. Specifying your server's serial number ensures that the results are focused on the server of interest.

    > **⚠️ Note**: Please be advised that sustainability insight data will
    > **not** be available at this time. Since your server was
    > only recently added to the COM instance, a minimum of one day is
    > required for sufficient data collection.
    > The screenshots are included to illustrate the anticipated output of
    > the cmdlets after several days of data collection.

2. If you want to view aggregate sustainability metrics for all servers managed by your COM instance, use the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSustainabilityInsights -Region $Region -EnergyConsumption
    ```

    > This screenshot illustrates the output generated by a COM instance operating with multiple servers:
    > ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image83.png)

    The report provides the total estimated energy consumption (in kilowatt-hours, kWh) for all servers in the specified region. The data includes collected values from the past 90 days (3 months), as well as projected consumption for the next 180 days (6 months) helping with planning and decision-making.

3. To retrieve this summary specifically for the EU Central region, use:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSustainabilityInsights -Region eu-central -EnergyConsumptionTotal
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image84.png)

4. Additionally, you can explore other sustainability insights by modifying the parameters:

    - **EnergyCost**: Displays energy cost data for your servers.

    - **Co2Emissions**: Provides information about carbon emissions.

5. To extend your historical data analysis, you can look back up to 180 days by using the **LookBackDays** parameter. For example, to estimate future CO2 emissions based on trends from the past 3 months, run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMSustainabilityInsights -Region $Region -Co2Emissions -LookBackDays 180
    ```

    This command returns projected CO2 emissions, allowing you to better assess and manage the environmental impact of your server operations.

## Task 3: Interacting with iLOs using Compute Ops Management SSO

Direct interaction with iLOs from this library is a key capability that
enhances server management efficiency. Starting in January 2025, Compute
Ops Management introduced support for single sign-on (SSO) access to
iLO, significantly streamlining the authentication process. This
advancement enables seamless integration with iLOs, allowing
administrators to perform a range of tasks---from executing native iLO
API RedFish commands to leveraging the HPEiLOCmdlets module for various
iLO operations. The following section outlines how to generate an iLO
access token and demonstrates several ways to interact with an iLO,
making day-to-day management tasks more intuitive and secure.

To authenticate to your server's iLO using single sign-on (SSO), follow these 4 steps for clarity and precision:

1. Generate an iLO SSO Session Object

    Run the following command to obtain a session object for SSO authentication. Replace with your server's serial number and ensure **$Region** is set appropriately.

    ```PowerShell
    $SSOObject = Get-HPECOMServer -Region $Region -Name $SN | Get-HPECOMServeriLOSSO -GenerateXAuthToken -SkipCertificateValidation
    ```
    
    This command generates an SSO session object, which you'll use to authenticate with HPEiLOCmdlets.

2. To view the details of the session object, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    $SSOObject
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image85.png)

    > **⚠️ Note**: SSO is currently not supported by servers managed
    > through HPE OneView via HPE Compute Ops Management - OneView
    > Edition (COM-OVE).

3. Install and import HPEiLOCmdlets

    If not already installed, add the HPEiLOCmdlets module to your environment and import it:

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module HPEiLOCmdlets
    Import-Module HPEiLOCmdlets
    ```

4. Connect to iLO Using the SSO Token

    Use the following command to establish a connection to your iLO, substituting with the appropriate IP address. The SSO token will be passed from the session object.

    ```PowerShell
    $connection = Connect-HPEiLO -Address $iLO_IP -XAuthToken $SSOObject."X-Auth-Token" -DisableCertificateAuthentication
    ```

    If the connection is successful, no error message will be returned.

5. To verify the connection, inspect the $connection object:

    ```PowerShell
    $connection
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image86.png)

6. Perform iLO Operations

    With the established connection, you can now execute various iLO management tasks. For example, to retrieve the iLO event log, use:

    ```PowerShell
    (Get-HPEiLOEventLog -Connection $connection).Eventlog
    ```

    These steps streamline the process of authenticating to iLO using Compute Ops Management SSO and enable you to manage your servers more efficiently with the PowerShell cmdlets.

## Task 4: Testing ILO settings configuration

In this task, you will verify that the iLO settings you configured in
your group (Step6 -- Task 1) have been correctly applied to your server.
Specifically, you will check the AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates
parameter, then change it and observe how COM detects the configuration
drift and re-applies the correct settings.

- **Step 1**: Verify the current iLO firmware policy setting

    Begin by querying the iLO directly with the HPEiLOCmdlets and your connection object to check the current firmware update policy. Use the following command to retrieve the firmware policy from your iLO:

    ```PowerShell
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy = Get-HPEiLOFirmwarePolicy -Connection $connection
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy.Accept3rdPartyFirmware
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image87.png)

    This command should return **false**, indicating that the AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates option is set to Disabled as per your group's iLO policy. With this setting, installation of third-party firmware on your server is blocked, aligning with recommended security
best practices.

- **Step 2**: Simulate a configuration drift by changing the setting in COM

    Now you will change the iLO setting in COM from ***Disabled*** to ***Enabled*** to simulate a configuration change. This will cause your server to become non-compliant with the group's iLO policy. Run this command to update the iLO setting:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-HPECOMSettingiLOSettings -Region $Region -Name $iLOSettingName -Description "iLO Settings for AI Servers" -VirtualMedia Enabled -PasswordComplexity Enabled -WebServerSSL Enabled -AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates Enabled
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image88.png)

- **Step 3**: Check the compliance status

    After changing the setting, check the group's compliance status. You should see that the iLO settings are now marked as not compliant because the group policy expects Disabled but the setting now says Enabled:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMGroup -Region $Region -Name $GroupName -ShowCompliance
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image89.png)

    The compliance check will show that your server's iLO configuration no longer matches the group's iLO policy.

- **Step 4**: Re-apply the correct iLO configuration

    Now you will use COM to re-apply the correct iLO configuration to your server. This will change the **AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates** parameter back to **Enabled** on the iLO itself. Run the following command using the Async parameter so you don't have to wait for the job to complete:

    ```PowerShell
    $task = Invoke-HPECOMGroupiLOConfiguration -Region $Region -GroupName $GroupName -ServerSerialNumber $SN -Async
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image90.png)

    The command returns the job status, indicating that it is currently in a *Running* state.

- **Step 5**: Monitor the job progress

    While the iLO configuration is being applied, you can check the job status using these commands:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -Category Group -ShowRunning
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -Category Group -JobResourceUri $task.resourceUri
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image91.png)

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPECOMJob -Region $Region -Category Group
    ```
    
    > ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image92.png)
    >
    > The job will take approximately 1 to 2 minutes to complete.
    >
    > ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image93.png)

- **Step 6**: Verify the setting has been applied

    Once the job is completed, query the iLO again to verify that AcceptThirdPartyFirmwareUpdates has been changed back to Enabled on your iLO:

    ```PowerShell
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy = Get-HPEiLOFirmwarePolicy -Connection $connection
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy.Accept3rdPartyFirmware
    $FirmwareUpdatePolicy
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image94.png)

    This should now return "**true**" confirming that COM successfully applied the new iLO configuration to your server.

**Key Learnings:**

- Methods for connecting to an iLO via SSO without the requirement of a dedicated iLO account.

- Techniques for directly querying iLO settings using HPEiLOCmdlets to verify current hardware configurations.

- Processes by which COM identifies configuration drift when group policies differ from server configurations.

- Use of Invoke-HPECOMGroupiLOConfiguration to re-apply relevant group policies to designated servers.

- Approaches for monitoring COM jobs in order to track the progress of configuration changes.

These points illustrate the effectiveness of COM's policy-based management approach, enabling administrators to specify desired states within group settings and allowing COM to automatically detect and remediate configuration drift across servers.

# Step 11 - Clean the lab for the next participant 
(Step 11 of 12) ⏱️ ~5 min

Before concluding the lab, follow these steps to clean up your
environment. Skipping these steps may leave resources locked to your
workspace, which could affect future lab sessions.

## Task 1: Remove your server from its service assignment

It is essential to remove a server from its current service assignment
before onboarding it to a different workspace. Failure to complete this
step will prevent successful reassignment of the server in another
environment.

1. Ensure you remove all devices from their service assignment by running:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLDevice | Remove-HPEGLDeviceFromService
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image95.png)

2. Confirm that the server has been removed from its assignment by running:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLDevice -ShowRequireAssignment
    ```

    The expected response should show no more service and region information:

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image96.png)

## Task 2: Remove the subscription key

Subscription keys are single-use on the HPE GreenLake platform, so it's
also important to delete your key from your workspace.

1. To delete your subscription key, run:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLSubscription | Remove-HPEGLSubscription
    ```
    
    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image97.png)

2. To verify that the subscription key has been removed, the following command should return no response:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLSubscription
    ```

## Task 3: Remove the COM service instance

Next, remove the COM service instance (the **$Region** you set earlier)
from your workspace. This will permanently remove all the COM resources,
logs and settings you set during this lab. This helps reduce unused
resources and lowers your carbon footprint.

1. To remove the COM service instance, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLService -ShowProvisioned | Remove-HPEGLService
    ```
    
    This action is permanent and cannot be undone. When you execute this cmdlet, you will receive a warning at runtime explaining the irreversible nature of the operation. The system will prompt you to confirm your choice.

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image98.png)

3. Type **Y** and press **Enter** to proceed with the removal

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image99.png)

4. To verify that the COM service instance has been removed, the following command should return no response:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-HPEGLService -ShowProvisioned
    ```

## Task 4: Disconnect from HPE GreenLake

The cleanup process is now complete. The final task, which cannot be
performed within the lab, is the deletion of the workspace itself. This
step can only proceed once all associated data---including devices and
users---has been removed from your workspace. These actions will be
carried out by our lab reset script following this session. Your final
responsibility is to disconnect from the HPE GreenLake platform, thereby
ending your session and deleting both the temporary API credentials
generated during connection and any related environment variables from
your command line terminal.

1. Begin by checking which HPE-related environment variables are still active in your session. To do this, run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Variable -Name hpe*
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image100.png)

    After completing the removal of the COM service instance in the previous task, you will observe that variables such as **$HPECOMRegions** are now empty. This confirms that the related resources have been successfully deleted from your environment.

2. To complete your session and disconnect from the HPE GreenLake platform, enter:

    ```PowerShell
    Disconnect-HPEGL
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image101.png)

    This command will terminate your session, remove any temporary API credentials, and clear related environment variables from your command line terminal.

3. To ensure all environment variables have been cleared from your session, run the following command one final time:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Variable -Name hpe*
    ```

    ![]( {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HOLs/COM-ZeroTouch/image102.png)

    This will display any remaining HPE-related variables. You may notice that several variables, such as **$HPEGreenLakeSession** (session information), **$HPECOMInvokeReturnData** (recent request output),
    **$HPEGLAPIClientCredentialName** (API credentials created during login), and **$HPEGLworkspaces** (workspace references) are no longer present, confirming their successful removal.

    This completes the automation workflow, ensuring that your environment is both provisioned and then properly cleaned up, leaving no residual resources.

Leveraging this script with the PowerShell library for Compute Ops Management (COM) dramatically accelerates and streamlines the resource management process within the HPE GreenLake platform. Tasks that would
traditionally require manual intervention---such as provisioning, configuration, and deprovisioning---are executed in a fraction of the time, minimizing human error and operational delays. By automating these
critical steps, administrators can efficiently scale operations, maintain consistency, and respond rapidly to changing business needs, all while ensuring that resources are optimally utilized and securely
managed from start to finish.

With this final step complete, you have successfully concluded the hands-on lab experience.

# Summary 

Throughout this lab, you explored how to automate server lifecycle management using the HPE Compute Ops Management PowerShell module. You:

- Installed the HPECOMCmdlets library and authenticated to HPE GreenLake.

- Created a workspace, add a user, provision a COM instance, configure a location, and install a subscription key.

- Onboarded a server to COM using an activation key, assigned location and tags, and verified device status.

- Created configuration policies for BIOS, storage, firmware, and iLO, then applied them through a server group.

- Checked and enforced compliance, monitored jobs, and retrieved detailed inventory, health, alerts, support, and warranty data.

- Used COM SSO to access iLO, detected configuration drift, and automatically re‑applied policy.

- Explored firmware compliance, scheduled updates, utilization insights, and sustainability metrics.

- Finished by cleaning the lab: remove device assignments, delete subscriptions, delete the COM instance, and disconnected.

- Finally, executed the COM-Zero-Touch-Automation PowerShell script to automate and streamline the entire configuration workflow---from provisioning and policy application to deprovisioning---enabling consistent, efficient, and error-free server management within the HPE
GreenLake platform.

Completing this lab provides you with a practical, end‑to‑end understanding of automated server management, enabling faster deployments, consistent configuration at scale, reduced manual effort, and improved operational reliability. It equips you with skills to
streamline onboarding, enforce policy‑driven governance, automate compliance, and leverage sustainability and utilization insights for smarter infrastructure decisions.

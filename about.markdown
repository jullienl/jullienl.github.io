In my role as a senior technology consultant in the WW Compute Business Group at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), I have the responsibility of enabling and supporting sales, pre-sales, channel partners, and end-user customers on various aspects related to HPE Compute, HPE solutions, and HPE edge-to-cloud services.

I have a deep passion for staying up-to-date with the latest developments and trends in DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, datacenter automation, and the various tools and integration techniques associated with them. I firmly believe in the benefits that using DevOps with HPE can bring, including increased agility, faster time to market, and improved quality.

I have created numerous demonstration scripts for HPE GreenLake, HPE OneView, HPE Synergy, and other related technologies. 

These scripts are available on my [GitHub repository]() for public access.
